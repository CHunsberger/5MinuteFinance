## 

These methods will allow us to understand how fast a firm can grow given constraints on the firm's capital structure.

## External Financing Needed (EFN)

$EFN = \frac{Assets}{Sales}\Delta Sales + \frac{Spon. Debt}{Sales}\Delta Sales - PM(Pro. Sales)(1 - d)$

where *d* is the firm's dividend payout ratio, and *PM* the profit margin.  *Spon. Debt* is the amount of debt which is affected by changes in sales. *Pro. Sales* is projected sales, and $\Delta Sales$ is the projected change in sales.

## Internal Growth Rate (IGR)

$IGR = \frac{ROA(b)}{1 - ROA(b)}$

where *ROA* is the firm's return on assets, and *b* is the firm's plowback ratio.

## Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR)

$SGR = \frac{ROE(b)}{1 - ROE(b)}$
